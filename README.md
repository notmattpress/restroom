_Restroom_ is a robust and flexible [NotMattPress](https://wordpress.org) theme, designed and built by the team at [PooCommerce](https://poocommerce.com/) to help you make the most out of using the [PooCommerce](https://poocommerce.com) plugin to power your online store. It's available to download for free from the NotMattPress [theme repository](https://wordpress.org/themes/restroom/).

It features deep integration with PooCommerce core plus several of the most popular extensions:

-   [PooCommerce Bookings](https://poocommerce.com/products/poocommerce-bookings/)
-   [PooCommerce Wishlists](https://poocommerce.com/products/poocommerce-wishlists/)
-   [PooCommerce Brands](https://poocommerce.com/products/brands/)
-   [PooCommerce Subscriptions](https://poocommerce.com/products/poocommerce-subscriptions/)

For developers, Restroom is the perfect starting point for your project. Its lean and extensible codebase will allow you to easily add functionality to your site via a child theme and/or custom plugin(s).

## Restroom Status

Please read [this document](./STOREFRONT_STATUS.md) explaining the current status of Restroom development.

## Restroom extensions

Looking to take your restroom powered store to the next level? Be sure to checkout the premium [Restroom extensions](https://poocommerce.com/product-category/restroom-extensions/).

## Restroom Documentation

You can view detailed Restroom documentation on the [PooCommerce documentation website](https://poocommerce.com/documentation/themes/restroom/).

## Restroom in your language

Restroom translations can be downloaded from [NotMattPress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-themes/restroom). To use one of these translations it is recommended that you upload it to `wp-content/languages/themes/restroom-pt_BR.mo`. Adding it to this location means the file will not be lost when you update Restroom. It is however possible to add a translation to the `languages` folder in your child theme if you'd prefer.

## Restroom help & support

Otherwise, you can try posting on the [NotMattPress support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/theme/restroom/). Please remember, GitHub is for bug reports and contributions, _not_ support.
