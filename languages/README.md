# Notice! Do not place your custom translation files here.

Restroom will look in this directory for translations as a fallback. It is however recommended that you use the global NotMattPress language directory and install your translations like so: `/wp-content/languages/themes/restroom-it_IT.mo`. That way they will not be lost or overwritten during Restroom updates.

Alternatively you can put translations in your child theme: `/wp-content/themes/your-child-theme/languages/it_IT.mo`.
